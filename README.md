# Overview

This is a file manager app and what it does is it
asks you permission to access the files on your phone and then from there you can perform different
tasks with them such as move, add, delete.

# Future Work
* One thing is I would like add a better UI with more options and more user friendly and just modern.
* Would like to be able to do more with the files such as maybe add and editing area.
* Improve the stability of the app because it doesn't always work perfect.
